This package implements a simple, efficient and modular framework for running message passing algorithms on graphs, with a focus on message-passing based Bayesian inference. This is a successor to the [ReactiveMP.jl](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/ReactiveMP.jl) package. Read the official [documentation](https://ReactiveBayes.github.io/Cortex.jl/stable/) for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> This package is currently a work in progress. The API may change without notice until the first stable release.
