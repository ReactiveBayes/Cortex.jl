# Cortex

Documentation for [Cortex](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/Cortex.jl).
Cortex is a simple, efficient and modular framework for running message passing algorithms on graphs, with a focus on message-passing based Bayesian inference. This is a successor to the [ReactiveMP.jl](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/ReactiveMP.jl) package.
